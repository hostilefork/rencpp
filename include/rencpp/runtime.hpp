// BASE RUNTIME CLASS
//

//
// The runtime class is a singleton, and at the time of writing a bit of
// a hodge-podge as to whether it should be all static methods or
// what.  One reason it is a singleton came from performance and also
// having it "taken care of automatically" in the examples.  The downside
// of instantiating it automatically is that people can't derive from it;
// but the advantages of doing so are not clear when Engine() and Context()
// exist.  evaluate is static, and used by Engine and Context which are
// independent of either the Rebol or Red runtime instance (ren::runtime)
//
// Note operator overloads must be members, so being able to talk to
// a ren::runtime.foo as well as say ren::runtime(...) requires such
// methods to *not* be static, which curiously could make evaluate faster
// than the paren notation
//

    //
    // How to do a cancellation interface properly in threading environments
    // which may be making many requests?  This simple interface assumes one
    // evaluator thread to whom a cancel is being made from another thread
    // (that is not able to do evaluations at the same time)... because that
    // is what Rebol implemented.  A better interface is needed.
